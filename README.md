# Text-Generator
My third big Python project. I`ve been doing it for two months. It was really hard but i made it.


This program generates ten random sentances from given text.

To make it work you have to put .txt file to the same directory as our program and put it`s name to the input of the 'Text Generator'. 'Text Generator' will output ten random sentences.

I used some Game of Thrones script to train my program. You can use it to check the programm (I added the file to repoitory as 'corpus.txt').
